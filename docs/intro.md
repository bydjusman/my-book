# Introduction

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" - a comprehensive 4-module textbook designed for undergraduate CS students and AI learners new to robotics.

## About This Book

This textbook bridges the gap between digital AI systems and physical robots, teaching you how to create embodied intelligence that can interact with the real world through humanoid robots. The book covers the full stack from basic middleware to advanced AI integration.

## Learning Path

The book is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI agents to robot controllers
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master simulation techniques for safe robot development
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Explore advanced perception and navigation systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Control robots with natural language commands

Each module builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive understanding of the full humanoid robotics stack.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Undergraduate CS students
- AI learners new to robotics
- Developers interested in physical AI and embodied intelligence

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of:
- Python programming
- Fundamental AI concepts
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## How to Use This Book

- Start with Module 1 and progress sequentially
- Each module contains 1500-2000 words of focused content
- Practice concepts with the provided examples
- Complete the capstone project in Module 4 to demonstrate your understanding

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
