# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

A comprehensive 4-module textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, designed for undergraduate CS students and AI learners new to robotics.

## Overview

This textbook bridges the gap between digital AI systems and physical robots, teaching how to create embodied intelligence that can interact with the real world through humanoid robots. The book covers the full stack from basic middleware to advanced AI integration.

## Modules

The textbook is organized into four progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Fundamentals of ROS 2 as middleware connecting AI agents to robot controllers
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation techniques for safe robot development
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Advanced perception and navigation systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Control robots with natural language commands

## Technology Stack

- **Documentation Framework**: Docusaurus
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
- **RAG System**: Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier) + OpenAI API
- **Language**: Markdown for content, JavaScript/React for components
